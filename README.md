- _okay they werent lying about the strongly typed shi_
- _kinda runes the point of len but who am i to judge_

**Day 2:**

- _overcomplicated objects, ok! (im just a js coder)_
- _and map iteration is orderless..? we here betting who comes first. nice feature i guess_
- _so no while loop but a for with if and break. perfect! (one more keyword wouldnt have hurt)_
